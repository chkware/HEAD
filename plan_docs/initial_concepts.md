**Problems**

- Developers don't have time to write test for software they develop
  
  - Writing test cases by programming language takes more time
    
    - Require learning the language, and domain knowledge of the tools, and know-how of commonly followed standards 

- Tester need to do regresstion on each release, taking more time & risk
  
  - as with each iteration software adds features & fixes those might lead to new set of issues

- Preparing test data is time consuming

- Test case execution by business flow is complex to devise

**Solutions Criteria**

- Command line base tools
  
  - can be run when needed ad-hoc
  
  - can be used after build/deploy automation

- Need low barriar of entry for fresher
  
  - less keyword is better
  - programming terms can be reusable from PHP

- Easy to generate random test data

- Business case based test case execution model

- Should be able to handle APIs, and multiple payload type: JSON, XML, SOAP, HTTP Request payload

**Users**

- Software developers / Testers / QAs who are on time constrains
  
  - People involve in project / labour oriented contracts

- People who want to do at least feature test for good

- Reuse existing knowledge, effectlively
